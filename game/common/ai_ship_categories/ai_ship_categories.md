# AI-only categorisation of ship types, used by the AI to organise its navy into fleets and to decide
# what to build. Membership is declared per ship type with ai_ship_category in common/ship_types.
# Every ship type must belong to exactly one of these.
#
# Referenced by ai_ship_category_weights in common/ai_strategies, both at the top level (the mix of
# ships the AI wants to own) and inside fleet_compositions (how those ships are split into fleets).
#
# These are deliberately separate from the ship_group in common/ship_groups, which drives
# construction modifiers, laws, technologies and how ships are presented to the player.
